Remaining concerns/ tasks:

1.1 use google calander API to add events to personal calander
  1.2 display certain events for every user instead of individual user
  1.3 have google calendar display username dynamically on program scheduling
2. update programscheduling.php to display programs once they are approved
3. update dutyswitch.php to display available duty shifts
4. programapproval.php needs to update query to be able to correctly approve files
5. (stretch goal) add professional staff pages to manage the other users
