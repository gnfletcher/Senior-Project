Remaining concerns/ tasks:

1.1 use google calander API to add events to personal calander
  1.2 display certain events for every user instead of individual user
2. update programscheduling.php to display programs once they are approved
3. update dutyswitch.php to display available duty shifts
4. professional staff pages are currently html files and need to be changed into php files
5. programapproval.php needs to update query to be able to correctly approve files
6. MUST BE DONE LAST: update any links to point to server instead of locally.
