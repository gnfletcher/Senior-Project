  -php function to store user_type and user_id, this allows customization for pages depending on the type of user that is signed in
  -finduser.php conditional statements
  - everything navigation bar related (something that seems so simple yet so time consuming and my biggest struggle)
      ARD, RD, RA nav bars sometimes redirect to the same page (i.e. every user can access the confiscation log page),
      but using my php functions I was able to customize the appropriate redirects according to user.
  - improved nav bar functionality further by creating ardnav, rdnav, and ranav files that hold the many lines of code
   customized according to user. Every specific user page uses my php function that uses "include __navbar" file, which is one line
   instead of using the many lines of nav bar code on every page.
